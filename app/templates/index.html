    <h1>Ticker Predictor</h1>
    <h2>Using Machine Learning to Predict Tomorrow's Stock Prices</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>Simply enter a valid stock ticker below with your phone number, and hit the predict button to receive a text message of tomorrow's predicted opening price of that stock within around 10 minutes!</h3>
    <h4>Unfortunately, when you hit predict, nothing will happen for ten minutes (the page will just be stuck loading) -> during this time, the prediction is being generated. But, after 10 minutes, a message will display on screen saying the text containg the stock price has been sent!</h4>
    <h5>The developer is working on generating output right away after you hit product (like wait 10 minutes)</h5>
